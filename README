Puppet setup for OSI's server(s)

This Git repository contains Puppet rules that express the desired
state of the Open Source Initiative's email server, called
gpl.opensource.org at the time of writing.  Applying these rules
configures three sets of things on that server:

- a Postfix server, with countermeasures for spam (via Spamassassin)
  and viruses (via Amavisd/ClamAV), with a set of authenticated SMTP
  users and some mail aliases;
- a Mailman daemon to serve mailing-lists (also integrated in
  Postfix);
- an Apache server for Mailman's web interface.

The repository contains the functional part of the setup, but not all
of the data.  Some of the data (mail aliases and user passwords) is
stored separately in a YAML file that ought to be stored under
hieradata/data/gpl.yaml (note that "gpl" should match the actual short
hostname of the server).

The OSI doesn't plan on using a master/agent Puppet setup, but to push
and apply these rules "manually".  Two convenience scripts have been
developed to help with deployment: test.sh (which compiles the Puppet
rules and display what would happen without actually applying them),
and apply.sh (which actually applies the rules to the server).
